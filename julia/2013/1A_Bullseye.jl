## One ring is (r+1)^2 - r^2     = 2r + 1  = 2r + 0 + 1
## 2nd ring is (r+3)^2 - (r+2)^2 = 2r + 5  = 2r + 4 + 1
## 3rd ring is (r+5)^2 - (r+4)^2 = 2r + 9  = 2r + 8 + 1
## 4th ring is (r+7)^2 - (r+6)^2 = 2r + 13 = 2r + 12 + 1
##
## Sum from ring 1 to k is 2*r*k + k + 4 * (0+1+2+3+...+(k-1))
##      = 2rk + k + 2*(k-1)*k

## For a bound, we restrict 2*r*k < 4*10^18 and we restrict k + 2*(k-1)*k < ~4*10^18
## for the second term 14*10^8 seems to be a good enough bound
