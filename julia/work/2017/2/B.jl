### We first figure out how many roller coaster rides we must have, and after that, we figure out
### how to accomplish that with the fewest promotions.
###
### It seems there for sure three things that can limit the number of rides that we must make
###    a) The number of tickets sold to any one person.
###    b) The number of tickets solt for the first seat
###    c) The total number of tickets sold for the "first N" seats
### If we can choose the minimum number of rides that satisfies all three of these constraints, then
### we are good.
###
### After we have these numbers, we simply fill our rides from back to front, and we promote only as
### much as needed.  This will count the promotions, and serve as a "check" on whether our math
### was right for the first part.
