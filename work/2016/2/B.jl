### a) We observe that the answer involves picking from the extremes.  To see this, suppose the
###    optimum has a point X for with P(y) < P(X) < P(Z) where Y and Z are not in the optimal set.
###    Fix the other members of the set, and let a/b be the probability that there are "half-1"/"half"
###    votes from the fixed members.  Then the probability of a tie is a * P(X) + b * (1-P(X)) which is
###    linear in P(X).  Thus, at least one of {Y,Z} should a better answer (or at least as good of an
###    answer in the case if a == b).
###
### b) Given 1:N ordered members, each with probability P(i) to vote yes, we can calculate the probability
###    of k yes votes after the first i members have votes with the recurrance
###            P(i,k) = P(i) * P(i-1,k-1) + (1-P(i)) * P(i-1,k)
###
### c) Out of an abundance of paranoia, we will use BigFloat for the math to avoid precision errors.
###
### d) This means we simply need to iterate through (K+1) sets of K folks.  The algorithm is then
###    O(K^3) + O(NlogN) (ignoring the need to grow the precision with increasing)
